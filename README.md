# Unity_Project_Alpha
Alpha version of the project for TUD


This game is designed for TuD as [Alpha Project](https://denysrudenko.github.io/Unity_Project_Alpha/).

## Introduction
**Galaxy Launcher** is a Unity game......

'We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity.'

-Ellen Ullman, Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## 4.1 Testing using tools

### 4.1.1 Google Developer Tools
I make use of google developer tools (Chrome DevTools). 

### 4.1.2 Responsive Tools

In order to make sure that design web pages are responsive, [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) page was used to check it. 
Also checked with a mobile phone Huawei p40 lite.

### 4.1.3 W3C Validator Tools

[W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) was used to check for any errors with my HTML pages.

See the pictures below:

![html](assets/images/html.png)

The HTML checker showed a perfect result.

[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to check for any error within my css file. I have a couple of errors with setting a property for margin in - 15px, and setting a font-weight with a property with px.I have a few warnings in the css file though.



See the pictures below:

# 5. Bugs
 [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  ### Solved bugs
- I had a few problems with a path to images.
- I had a bug with a setTiomeOut function in a js file with a timer, the start animation didn't work properly. Fixed with playing with different timer options.

 
See the gif bellow:

![test](/assets/images/bug.gif)

I decided to make a fixed qube around Js, there is a lot a qubes already hanging around the page.
